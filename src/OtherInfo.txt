Yosh Recycle is an indigenous waste recovery and recycling enterprise committed to environmental sustainability and to fulfilling our shared responsibility to protect the planet.

We are dedicated to improving the environment for the communities we live in and serve. Our work plays a vital role in enhancing environmental quality, and we are passionate about creating a sustainable society for all our key stakeholders - households, businesses, suppliers, local communities, employees, regulators, government agencies, and investors.

Our Vision

To rid the world of plastic waste, one country at a time.
We believe that all plastic waste should be recyclable or reusable, and we are committed to embedding recycling into everyday life while supporting long-term environmental development.

Our Mission

To divert plastic waste from landfills.

To provide manufacturers in Nigeria and abroad with a reliable supply of high-quality recycled raw materials.

To make recycling accessible, cost-effective, and convenient for individuals, households, and businesses.

What We Do

We work with individuals, households, organisations, and businesses looking to recycle or dispose of plastic responsibly.
Our goal is to make the process simple and free:

🏠 Household Recycling Programme (Free)

Households can sign up at no cost.

Each registered home receives a Yosh Recycle bag for collecting clean plastics.

Collections are scheduled weekly or monthly - at no charge to the household.

Our customer service team contacts each household to schedule pick-up or drop-off days.

🤝 Community & Business Partnerships

We collaborate with estates, schools, small businesses, churches, and community groups to build a recycling culture and improve environmental outcomes.

Our Impact Commitment

Through our operations, we aim to:

Reduce plastic pollution across Lagos and beyond.

Support job creation in the recycling value chain.

Strengthen Nigeria's circular economy.

Build healthier communities for present and future generations.



Products & Services

At Yosh Recycle, we focus on the recovery, sorting, and recycling of key waste materials that are commonly generated in Nigerian households and businesses. Our initial operations centre on plastics, aluminium cans, and pure water sachets, with plans to expand into additional recyclable materials as we scale.

1. Household & Individual Recycling Programme (Free Service)

We provide individuals and households with branded Yosh Recycle bags for collecting clean recyclables.
Customers are shown how to sort their materials into the correct categories, ensuring higher quality and easier processing.

How It Works:

Customers receive one or more Yosh Recycle bags.

They sort their items (plastics, cans, pure water sachets) into designated categories.

Once the bag is full, they request a pickup via phone, WhatsApp, or the website.

Our team collects the recyclables from their home or preferred location at no cost.

This service encourages proper waste separation at source and supports our mission of reducing landfill waste.

2. Recyclables Collection for Estates, Schools & Businesses

We offer scheduled collection services to:

Residential estates

Schools

Small and medium-sized businesses

Community groups and churches

Restaurants and event venues

Clients can request regular pickup schedules (weekly or monthly), or on-demand collections for larger quantities.

3. Material Sorting & Recycling

We process and sort collected materials into market-ready categories such as:

PET bottles

HDPE containers

Aluminium cans

Pure water sachets (nylon waste)

These materials are sold to recycling manufacturers and processors within Nigeria or prepared for export, supporting local industry and the broader circular economy.

4. Future Service Expansion

As we grow, Yosh Recycle plans to expand into additional recyclable streams, including:

Used paper

New and used cartons

Glass bottles and containers

Plastic bowls, buckets, and household plastic items

Broken plastic furniture

This phased expansion will allow us to increase our environmental impact and create more green jobs across our collection routes.



What We Do

1. Collection

We collect used polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles and aluminium cans from individuals, households, businesses, landfills, dumpsites, and kerbsides for onward processing at our facility.
Whether gathered by our trained field collectors or dropped off by community members, PET bottles that are empty, dry, and capped form the primary raw materials for our recycling operations.

2. Sorting

Upon arrival at the factory, all collected PET bottles undergo careful manual and mechanical sorting.
Caps and labels are removed, and the bottles are separated according to colour to ensure the highest quality output.
This stage is labour-intensive and provides reliable employment-particularly for the women who form the backbone of our sorting team.

3. Grinding

The sorted PET bottles are then fed into industrial grinding machines, where they are cut and processed into fine, unwashed PET flakes.
This process is managed by skilled operators who ensure consistency, safety, and quality throughout the grinding stage.

4. Export / Sales

The resulting PET flakes are bagged, weighed, and supplied to manufacturers and recycling companies who further refine the material.
These flakes serve as valuable raw input for the production of new products such as textiles, packaging materials, plastic strapping, and other recycled plastic goods.

How to Correctly Recycle PET Bottles

Ensure all liquid is drained from the bottle.

Squeeze the bottle to reduce volume.

Leave the cap on before placing it inside your Yosh Recycle bag.
